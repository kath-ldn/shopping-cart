# Shopping Cart wth ReactJS V2.0

## About

This is a simple website with a shopping cart for an online store that I made using ReactJS. The purpose of this was to practice using react-router and routes, as well as hooks/ReactJS more broadly. I developed it for [The Odin Project, Full Stack Javascript course, Javascript Module (React Projects)](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart).

As the user moves through the site, they can add and substract different items to their cart. When they are finished, they visit a checkout screen (by clicking on the cart), which displays all the items selected and their total cost.

## Roadmap

For the next version I will:
* Continue to refactor - some areas of duplication in JS & styles;
* Re-examine at data structures - whether particularly CartContext is stored in most efficient way (particularly when passing to Checkout);
* Add mobile/device responsiveness (currently just Web);
* 'Back' feature/navigation;
* Add item descriptions.

### Known Issues

* Not responsive/suited to all devices.
